```javascript
// Correct aggregation pipeline
db.collection.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { /* some filter */ }
  }, 
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$fieldName",
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  }, 
  {
    $sort: { count: -1 }
  },
  {
    $limit: 10 }
])
//In this corrected version, the $limit is correctly applied only after all other stages are completed, accurately returning the top 10 documents.
